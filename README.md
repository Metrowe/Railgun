# Summary
A top down On-Rails Shooter with multiple weapons, a map creator and most improtantly trains;
Map data is stored and loaded from a file and used to create followable tracks, multiple files can be saved and loaded. 
In versus mode you and a friend can choose your loadouts, select a default or user created map to play on and battle till only one train is left rolling.
In the map maker after you select a map to modify you can easily create tracks of varying shapes and sizes.

# Highlights
* The inheritence and polymorphism for the engine classes allowed for chaining of different classes together to assemble the train.
